# N-sight AI Connect — Partner Setup Guide

Connect your AI assistant to N-sight RMM and start querying your managed environment in plain language — no scripting, no dashboards.

This guide covers setup for **Claude Desktop**, **ChatGPT Desktop**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, and **Microsoft Copilot Studio**.

---

## What Is N-sight AI Connect?

N-sight AI Connect is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that runs locally on your machine and bridges your AI assistant to your N-sight account. Once connected, you can ask natural-language questions like:

- *"Which of my clients have failing checks right now?"*
- *"Show me all devices at Contoso that are missing critical patches."*
- *"Give me a health summary across all my managed clients."*
- *"Clear the failing disk check on CONTOSO-DC01 and add a note."*

The server handles all communication with N-sight. Your AI client never sees your API key — only the data N-sight returns.

---

## Before You Start

You need three things regardless of which AI client you use.

### 1. Node.js 18 or later

Check if you already have it:

```
node --version
```

If the output shows `v18.x.x` or higher, you're ready. Otherwise, download and install the **LTS version** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Accept all defaults during installation.

### 2. Your N-sight API Key

1. Log in to your N-sight dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** (top-right menu) > **General Settings**
3. Click the **API** tab
4. Copy your API key. If you don't have one, click **Generate** to create one.

Keep this key private. It grants full access to your N-sight account.

### 3. Your Regional Server URL

| Your N-sight login URL contains | Use this URL |
|---|---|
| `systemmonitor.us` | `https://www.systemmonitor.us` |
| `systemmonitor.eu` | `https://www.systemmonitor.eu` |
| `wwwasia.systemmonitor.us` | `https://wwwasia.systemmonitor.us` |

Not sure? Check the URL bar when you log in to N-sight.

---

## Installation

Download and install N-sight AI Connect from the GitHub Releases page.

**Steps:**

1. Go to the [N-sight AI Connect Releases](https://github.com/nable-opensource/N-sight-MCP-Server/releases) page
2. Download the latest release zip: `nsight-mcp-server-vX.X.X.zip`
3. Unzip it to a permanent location, for example:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Tools\nsight-mcp-server\`
   - **Mac:** `~/Tools/nsight-mcp-server/`
4. Open a terminal, navigate to that folder, and run:
   ```
   npm install --omit=dev
   ```

Keep note of the full path to the `dist/` folder inside — you will need it in the config steps below.

---

## Setup: Claude Desktop

### Step 1: Locate the config file

**Windows:**
Press `Win + R`, type `%APPDATA%\Claude\` and press Enter. Open `claude_desktop_config.json`. If it doesn't exist, create a new text file with that exact name.

**Mac:**
Open Finder, press `Cmd + Shift + G`, paste `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` and press Go. Open `claude_desktop_config.json`.

### Step 2: Add the configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nsight": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Tools\\nsight-mcp-server\\dist\\readonly-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NSIGHT_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "NSIGHT_SERVER_URL": "https://www.systemmonitor.us"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> On Mac, use forward slashes: `"/Users/yourname/Tools/nsight-mcp-server/dist/readonly-server.js"`

If you already have other MCP servers configured, add the `"nsight"` block inside the existing `"mcpServers"` section — don't replace the whole file.

### Step 3: Save and restart Claude Desktop

Save the file. **Fully quit Claude Desktop** (don't just close the window — on Windows, right-click the system tray icon and choose Quit). Reopen it.

### Step 4: Verify

Open a new conversation and type:
```
List all my N-sight clients.
```

Claude should respond with your live client list from N-sight.

---

## Setup: ChatGPT Desktop

ChatGPT configures MCP connections through its web settings rather than a local config file.

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

1. Go to [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) and sign in
2. Click your profile icon (top-right) > **Settings**
3. Navigate to **Apps & Connectors**
4. Enable **Developer Mode** if prompted

### Step 2: Add the MCP server

1. Click **Add connector** or **Add MCP server**
2. Fill in the fields:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `N-sight AI Connect` |
| Transport | `stdio` |
| Command | `node` |
| Arguments | `C:\Tools\nsight-mcp-server\dist\readonly-server.js` |
| NSIGHT_API_KEY | your API key |
| NSIGHT_SERVER_URL | your regional URL |

### Step 3: Save and verify

Save the connector. Open a new chat and type:
```
List all my N-sight clients.
```

---

## Setup: OpenAI Codex CLI

Codex CLI is OpenAI's command-line AI agent. It stores MCP configuration in a TOML file.

### Step 1: Install Codex CLI

If you don't have it:
```
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### Step 2: Add the MCP server

**Using the CLI (easiest):**

```
codex mcp add nsight
```

Follow the prompts to enter the command, arguments, and environment variables.

**Or edit the config file directly:**

Open `~/.codex/config.toml` (create it if it doesn't exist) and add:

```toml
[mcp_servers.nsight]
command = "node"
args = ["/Users/yourname/Tools/nsight-mcp-server/dist/readonly-server.js"]

[mcp_servers.nsight.env]
NSIGHT_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
NSIGHT_SERVER_URL = "https://www.systemmonitor.us"
```

### Step 3: Verify

```
codex "List all my N-sight clients."
```

---

## Setup: Microsoft Copilot Studio

### Step 1: Open your agent

In [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com), open the agent you want to connect to N-sight, or create a new one.

### Step 2: Add an MCP action

1. In the left panel, select **Actions**
2. Click **Add an action**
3. Choose **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

### Step 3: Configure the connection

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server type | `stdio` |
| Command | `node` |
| Arguments | `C:\Tools\nsight-mcp-server\dist\readonly-server.js` |
| NSIGHT_API_KEY | your API key |
| NSIGHT_SERVER_URL | your regional URL |

### Step 4: Save and test

Save the agent. Open a test conversation and type:
```
List all my N-sight clients.
```

## Read-Only vs Production Server

You've set up the **Read-Only** server above. It gives your AI assistant full visibility into your N-sight environment — clients, devices, checks, patches, AV, backups — but cannot change anything.

The **Production** server adds 13 remediation actions: clearing checks, approving patches, running tasks, managing AV scans, and more.

### Adding the Production server

The Production server runs alongside the Read-Only server. Add a second entry to your config using the same steps above, replacing `readonly-server.js` with `production-server.js`.

Add these additional environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NSIGHT_MAX_WRITES_PER_SESSION` | `20` | Max actions before restart required |
| `NSIGHT_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` | `true` | Record all actions to a log file |
| `NSIGHT_AUDIT_LOG_PATH` | `C:\Logs\nsight-audit.log` | Where to write the audit log |

**Example for Claude Desktop:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nsight": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Tools\\nsight-mcp-server\\dist\\readonly-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NSIGHT_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "NSIGHT_SERVER_URL": "https://www.systemmonitor.us"
      }
    },
    "nsight-production": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Tools\\nsight-mcp-server\\dist\\production-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NSIGHT_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "NSIGHT_SERVER_URL": "https://www.systemmonitor.us",
        "NSIGHT_MAX_WRITES_PER_SESSION": "20",
        "NSIGHT_AUDIT_LOG_PATH": "C:\\Logs\\nsight-audit.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How the Production server confirms actions

Every write action requires your explicit approval before it executes. The AI shows you a preview first:

**You ask:**
```
Clear the failing disk check on CONTOSO-DC01.
```

**AI responds (nothing has happened yet):**
```
I'll clear check ID 9876 on device CONTOSO-DC01. Confirm?
```

**You confirm:**
```
Yes, go ahead.
```

**AI executes and confirms:**
```
Done. Check cleared successfully at 14:23 UTC.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No N-sight tools appear in my AI client"

- Fully quit and reopen your AI client (don't just close the window)
- Check your config file for missing commas or brackets — paste the JSON into [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to validate
- Confirm Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`

### "NSIGHT_API_KEY and NSIGHT_SERVER_URL must be set"

- Confirm both values are in the `env` section of your config
- Check there are no extra spaces around the values
- Make sure the file was saved before restarting your AI client

### "The client list comes back empty"

- Verify your regional URL matches your N-sight login URL
- Confirm your API key is active: N-sight > Settings > General Settings > API
- Try logging into N-sight in a browser with the same credentials to confirm access

### "I get a rate limit error"

N-sight allows 60 API calls per minute. The server queues and throttles automatically. Wait a moment and try again — no action needed.

### "The Production server isn't appearing separately"

Check that the two servers have different keys in your config (`"nsight"` and `"nsight-production"`). If they share the same key, one overwrites the other.

---

## Security

- **Your API key never leaves your machine.** It is passed directly from your local config to the N-sight API. The AI client never sees it.
- **The Production server cannot act without your confirmation.** Every write action shows a preview and waits for your explicit approval.
- **All Production actions are audit-logged** before they execute, with operator, action, parameters, and timestamp.
- **Scope your API key** to a specific client group by setting `NSIGHT_CLIENT_ID` in your config. Useful for multi-tenant environments where different technicians manage different clients.
